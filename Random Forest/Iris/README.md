This project demonstrates how to apply a Random Forest Classifier to the classic Iris dataset using Python and scikit-learn. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning, containing features of three types of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica).

The notebook covers:

Loading and exploring the dataset

Preparing features and target labels

Training a Random Forest model

Evaluating model performance

The model achieves an accuracy of about 96.7% on the test data.

# 🌳 Random Forest Classifier on Iris Dataset

This repository contains a simple implementation of a **Random Forest Classifier** on the classic **Iris dataset** using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
The Iris dataset includes 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features:
- Sepal length (cm)  
- Sepal width (cm)  
- Petal length (cm)  
- Petal width (cm)  

The target variable represents three flower species:
- *Setosa*  
- *Versicolor*  
- *Virginica*  

The goal is to classify the flower species based on the given features.
