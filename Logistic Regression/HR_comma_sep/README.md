# üî¢ Logistic Regression Project  

## üìå Overview  
This project demonstrates how to use **Logistic Regression** for a classification task.  
It covers the complete workflow from loading the dataset, performing cleaning and preprocessing, to training the model and checking its accuracy.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Workflow  

1. **Data Loading**  
   - Loaded dataset into a pandas DataFrame.  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values.  
   - Renamed and adjusted column names for easier usage.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Used pandas methods to explore the dataset.  
   - Checked feature relationships with simple plots (Matplotlib / Seaborn).  

4. **Preprocessing**  
   - Applied scaling/normalization where necessary to prepare data for the model.  

5. **Model Training**  
   - Implemented Logistic Regression using:  
     ```python
     from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
     ```  
   - Fitted the model on training data.  

6. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated accuracy of the model using `.score()` and predictions.  

7. **Prediction**  
   - Generated predictions for test data.
